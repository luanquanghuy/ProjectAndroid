I develop Android Rivers using <a href="http://kotlin.jetbrains.org/">Kotlin programming language</a> version M8. It might not be
obvious that this is Kotlin project since there are a lot of Java code in the project. Most of these Java code are open source
libraries that Android Rivers include in source form by necessity. Most of the Kotlin code is located at NewsEngine module and
com.silverkeytech.android_rivers package at the main project.
